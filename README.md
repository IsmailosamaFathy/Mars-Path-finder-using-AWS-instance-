# These are the work milestones & short describtion of each one 
## Implementing your first AWS Greengrass Group
1.Configure a Greengrass Core.
2.Publish the data of a simulated sensor using an AWS Greengrass device.
3.Receive the data of the sensor in a second AWS Greengrass device.
## Target Detection
1.Acquire the data from different sources.
2.Process the data in an embedded device.
3.Model and program the crawler’s behavior
## Porting the AWS service to the system 
– Configure the given topics and deploy the configuration
– Configure the localization system to publish the position of the target and the rover
– Subscribe the ESP32 board to the topics and receive the inf. from the localization
system
## System behaviour
– The start position and direction are unknown. Also the position of the obstacles are
unknown
– If the target is not found within 90 seconds the you will not get the points for the attempt
– The team that reaches the target in the shortest time gets all points
